  ## Features

  This project is intented to bring the user a way to keep track of all of their merchandise in a database. Every product is in a category and has a product tags which are described with their name, price, amount of stock and their category ids. Product tags are also included to give a more detailed way of identification. 

  ## Installation
   User must install the following packages: sequelize, dotenv, express,and mysql2. They must also ensure that under "scripts" in the package.json file there is one called "seed":node seeds/index.js in order to add the seeds. Also the .env folder will need to be updated with the users sql username and password. Then, the first thing the
    1. user will need to do is open up mysql by loggin in and then running the schema.sql file inside of the db folder. 
    2. Then they will exit sql and do the "npm run seed" which will add all of the seeds by adding them into dynamically produced tables into the open database.
    3.  After this, the testing and adding of new information can take place in Insomnia, as shown in the demo video.
